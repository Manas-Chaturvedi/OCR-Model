This repository provides a basic implementation of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using Python. It demonstrates the process of preprocessing images and extracting text from them using the Tesseract OCR engine. The code includes essential features such as image preprocessing steps involving grayscale conversion, thresholding, and noise removal to enhance OCR accuracy, as well as text extraction using the pytesseract library. Designed with a modular approach, the code allows for easy customization and further development. To use this, you'll need Python 3.x, OpenCV (cv2), Tesseract OCR (pytesseract), and PIL (Pillow) installed. Simply install the required Python packages, install Tesseract OCR and configure its path, place your image file, and run the script. While this is a simple implementation, it serves as a good starting point and may require additional improvements for production environments, particularly for handling complex or low-quality images. Contributions to enhance this project are welcome.
